Starter code for Code Wars 2.0 Round 3, Decipher the Code

    There are a total of 4 salts to be added to the Plain-text before hashing. The Position of salts are below in the code block(same as this). Answer the question to decrypt the position and find the position.

### Hint 1
Substitute the Alphabets (It's Simple, for eg A->E, B -> J, etc.)

From here, the salt postions are [encrypted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher). To decrypt the position 
- Find the answer for the question,
- go to  https://cryptii.com/pipes/vigenere-cipher
- Set it to decode mode (in the middle card)
- Paste the below hash on the left side
- Enter your answer in the "KEY" attribute
- You should have the salt position on the right

### Hint 2
- The Encryption Standard written by RSA, which competed with Rijndael to become AES.

### Hint 3
- An Algorithm discovered in the 90s, which not only proves its new computing strategy, but also broke public-key cryptography schemes which run the internet today.

### Hint 4
- Nick name of the exploit which compromised windows systems, where the user passwordâ€™s hash and its key was stored in the memory. This was used heavily in the initial years of international ransomware attacks.
